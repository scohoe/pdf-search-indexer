## Requirements

- **WordPress**: 5.0 or higher
- **PHP**: 7.2 or higher
- **Memory**: Recommended 256MB+ for processing large PDFs
- **Dependencies**: smalot/pdfparser (automatically included in distribution)

## Usage

After activation, the plugin will automatically begin indexing PDF files as they are uploaded to your media library. You can also manually trigger indexing of all existing PDFs from the settings page.

### Settings

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does the plugin handle large PDF files?

For PDFs larger than the maximum size setting, the plugin uses an alternative processing method that extracts metadata and text from only the first few pages to prevent memory issues.

### Can the plugin index password-protected PDFs?

No, password-protected or secured PDFs cannot be indexed. The plugin will detect these files and mark them accordingly.
